In this preview of my soundscape, I have the beginning noises to set the scene where the soundscape is taking place. One thing I wanted to make sure to do was to gather enough sounds in the beginning to ensure that the listener could picture the setting accurately in their mind. The sounds that I entered were a door opening and closing, footsteps, sitting down in a chair, opening a laptop, and clicking ang typing on a laptop. All of the entered sounds so far have been sourced from Freesounds online. I might add at the very beginning a quick convo to introduce the narrator to the listener. Possibly me saying out loud "I have to go! Its starts in 2 minutes" to help further set the scene of a zoom class. One thing I have struggled with so far is the relative sounds of each track in compared to each other. I’m questioning how loud each sounds should be to make it the most realistic in special relation to the narrator. Next steps for me will be some self-recording inner thoughts and adding more outside noises for the narrator to react to. I also have to find a Zoom class audio or lecture type recording to simulate a professor’s class. This will the be constant noise in the background of the entire soundscape. I also plan on looking up how to either distort the voice or add some background noise to ensure the listener can distinguish the narrator’s inner thoughts from what I say out loud. I am still learning all the features of audacity and ow to move, edit and manipulate the tracks to make a more dynamic experience. I also have to record myself for the first time, because so far I have only sourced my sounds from the internet. I anticipate this taking some time and adjusting to the learning curve. I also plan on attending office hours to ask some more questions about the formatting of the assets of Github.
